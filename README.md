# DevWiki
#### Your company has a wiki, why shouldn't you? 

DevWiki is a personal wiki for developers. Use it to keep track of your notes, ideas, and todos.
Say no! to the endless tabs in your text editor. Say yes! to DevWiki.
 
## Features
That don't exist yet lol. 

### Lightning Fast Search
Search through your notes in the blink of an eye. Using the search by all search bar you can quickly locate 
notes by title, content, or tags. 

### Markdown Notes
DevWiki notes are written in markdown. This means you can easily add formatting to your notes in a syntax that all 
developers are familiar with.

### Encrypted Blocks 
DevWiki supports encrypted blocks. Encrypted blocks are similar to Markdown code blocks in definition
```
    ```enc
     secrets
    ``` 
```
The content of an encrypted block is encrypted client side using your encryption secret before being sent to the server.
This means you can store sensitive information in your notes without worrying about the server owner (me)
snooping through your sensitive information. The only downside is, search cannot be performed on encrypted blocks. 

## Development
