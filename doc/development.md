# Development Environment

# Linux
### Pre-requisites
install the following tools.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

You might also want to install these awesome tools. Not required but they sure are epic! 
- [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s)
- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
- [kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)

### Setup
There are two ways you can op to setup the devwiki dev environment. You can either create cluster once using 
```bash 
./devcluster/setup.sh 
```
Then run skaffold to deploy the application when you want to work on it
```bash 
skaffold dev
```

Or you can run the `dev.sh` to bootstrap everything all at once. This will create a new cluster each time you run it.
and teardown the cluster when you're done. This is a great way to make sure you're always working with an updated & clean slate. 
```bash
./dev.sh
```

Whatever option you opt for you will also need to put an entry in your `/etc/hosts` file 
```
172.17.0.1 dev.devwiki.io
```


Now you should now be able to see devwiki running in your browser at [dev.devwiki.io](http://dev.devwiki.io) ðŸŽ‰.


# Windows 

### Step 1 
Install Linux. Don't worry about any partitions called "Windows" you won't need those anymore. Just overwrite them with Linux. ðŸ¤£
